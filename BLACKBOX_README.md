# Git Commands

This document describes the most commonly used Git commands. For more information, please refer to the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## git status

The `git status` command shows the current state of the repository. It lists all the files that have been modified, added, or deleted since the last commit.

```
git status
```

## git clone

The `git clone` command clones a repository from a remote server. This creates a local copy of the repository that you can work on.

```
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

## git pull

The `git pull` command fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into the current branch. This is useful when you want to update your local copy of a repository with the latest changes.

```
git pull
```

## git checkout

The `git checkout` command switches to a different branch. This is useful when you want to work on a different part of the project.

```
git checkout branch-name
```

## git log

The `git log` command shows the history of a repository. This is useful when you want to see what changes have been made to a project over time.

```
git log
```

## git branch

The `git branch` command creates, lists, and deletes branches. This is useful when you want to create a new branch to work on a new feature, or to delete a branch that is no longer needed.

```
git branch branch-name
```

## git add

The `git add` command adds a file to the staging area. This is the first step in the process of committing changes to a repository.

```
git add file-name
```

## git commit

The `git commit` command creates a snapshot of the changes that have been added to the staging area. This is the second step in the process of committing changes to a repository.

```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

## git push

The `git push` command pushes changes from the local repository to a remote repository. This is the third and final step in the process of committing changes to a repository.

```
git push origin master
```

## git merge

The `git merge` command merges two branches together. This is useful when you want to combine changes from two different branches into a single branch.
